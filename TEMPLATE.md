# Samba-SocialTicket vApp Proposal

## Project Information

**Project Name:** Samba-SocialTicket  
**Category:** social  
**GitHub Username:** [pichanesantana-cloud]  
**Discord ID:** [@r3nato7732]  
**Team Size:** 3 (Developer)

## Project Overview

### Description
Samba-SocialTicket is a decentralized social ticketing platform that leverages blockchain technology to create transparent, secure, and community-driven event management. The platform enables users to create, distribute, and manage event tickets while building social reputation through verified attendance and community interactions.

### Key Features
- **Decentralized Event Creation:** Users can create events with smart contract-backed tickets
- **Social Verification:** Attendance verification through community consensus and cryptographic proofs
- **Reputation System:** Build and maintain social reputation based on event history and community interactions
- **NFT Ticketing:** Each ticket is an NFT with unique properties and transferability rules
- **Community Governance:** Event organizers and attendees participate in dispute resolution

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Smart Contracts (Move Language)
```move
// Simplified contract structure
module samba_tickets::event_manager {
    struct Event has key, store {
        id: UID,
        creator: address,
        title: String,
        description: String,
        max_capacity: u64,
        ticket_price: u64,
        event_date: u64,
        is_active: bool,
    }

    struct Ticket has key, store {
        id: UID,
        event_id: ID,
        owner: address,
        attendance_verified: bool,
        transfer_count: u8,
    }

    struct UserReputation has key {
        id: UID,
        user: address,
        events_attended: u64,
        events_created: u64,
        reputation_score: u64,
    }
}
```

#### 2. Soundness Layer Integration

**Data Storage:**
Utilizaremos o Walrus para armazenamento de dados off-chain, onde os usuários podem submeter requests ao Soundness Layer chamando a função new_proof no smart contract Move

**Proof Submission:**
- Event metadata stored on Walrus
- Attendance proofs submitted via blob ID to Soundness Layer
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving reputation calculations

**Technical Integration Points:**
1. **Event Metadata Storage:** Large event data (images, descriptions, media) stored on Walrus
2. **Attendance Verification:** ZK proofs submitted to Soundness Layer for attendance verification
3. **Reputation Calculations:** Privacy-preserving reputation scoring using zero-knowledge proofs
4. **Data Integrity:** All event and ticket data verified through Soundness Layer's verification system

### Architecture Flow
```
User Creates Event → Store metadata on Walrus → Deploy Move contract on Sui
    ↓
Ticket Purchase → NFT Minting → Store transaction proof on Soundness Layer
    ↓
Event Attendance → ZK Proof Generation → Submit to Soundness Layer
    ↓
Reputation Update → Privacy-preserving calculation → Update on-chain reputation
```

## Business Model & Impact

### Target Market
- Event organizers (concerts, conferences, workshops)
- Community builders and social groups
- Verification-required events (professional conferences, exclusive gatherings)

### Social Impact
- **Transparency:** All ticket sales and transfers are publicly verifiable
- **Anti-Fraud:** Blockchain-based tickets prevent counterfeiting
- **Community Building:** Reputation system encourages positive community participation
- **Decentralization:** Reduces dependency on centralized ticketing monopolies

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React/Next.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Wallet Integration:** Sui Wallet, Ethos Wallet
- **State Management:** Zustand

### Backend/Blockchain
- **Smart Contracts:** Move language on Sui Network
- **Data Storage:** Walrus Protocol via Soundness Layer
- **Verification:** Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- **Authentication:** Sui Wallet signatures

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting:** Vercel/Netlify for frontend
- **IPFS:** Backup metadata storage
- **API:** Node.js/Express for auxiliary services

## Proof of Concept Features

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
1. Create simple events with basic information
2. Mint NFT tickets with unique identifiers
3. Verify ticket ownership on-chain
4. Basic attendance marking system
5. Simple reputation display

### Soundness Layer Specific Features
- Event metadata storage on Walrus
- ZK proof submission for attendance verification
- Privacy-preserving reputation calculations
